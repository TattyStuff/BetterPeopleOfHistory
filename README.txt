# BetterPeopleOfHistory
For those of you who want less no-brainers, more people, and more fun!
This mod for EU4 is just basically a fix for the 'WiH' DLC, as well as enhancing the men in history.
Not ironman compatible, although it really should be.

Installation:

Open your Dendy, place the floppy disk in the sidecart, burn a joss stick that the devs start caring about SP at some
point, and then the mod will automagically install!
